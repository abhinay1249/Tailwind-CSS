Tailwind CSS ----------------> An additional advantage for simplifying the verbose CSS.
    
    ** It does supports component libraries such as:-
        --> tailwind UI
        --> headess UI
        --> sailboat UI
        --> daisy UI
        --> tailblocks
        --> shadcn
    ** These are the reusable codes that can be used again and again, whereas the general CSS cannot be reusable.
    **  {t/b/l/r}-{<size>} this can be used for either margin alignment or padding.
            {x} is used for both left and right at a time for x axis.
            {y} is used for both top and bottom at a time for y axis.
                eg:- mt-4, mx-4, pt-2, p-4
    ** For the alignment in clear,
        --> Use Flex justify-center items-center, these try to put the text aligned with the div in center.
    ** To get the text font size use, 
        eg:- <text-[30px]> 
    ** justify content is more used in the horizontal alignment for FlexBox.
    ** align-items is used more in the vertical alignment for FlexBox.
    ** Flex-flow is a combination of both flex-direction and flex-wrap.
